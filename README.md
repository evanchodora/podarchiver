## PodArchiver

Simple Python 3 script to download and archive podcasts from an RSS feed.
Add RSS feeds to a `feeds.txt` file and run `podarchiver`.

PodArchiver downloads episode cover art, description information, and MP3 files in organized directories.
An `archive.log` file tracks the downloaded episode GUIDs so it will skip already archived episodes when the script is run again.
